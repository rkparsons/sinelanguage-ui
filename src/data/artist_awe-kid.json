    "body": "Rick Parsons, a.k.a. Awe Kid, is a multi-instrumentalist based between London and Berlin. Growing up in Manchester, UK, Parsons spent his teens and twenties playing in local post-hardcore outfits before discovering and immersing himself more heavily into dance music. Taking in influences from various, more focussed subgenres of electronica, from 90's era Warp through post-rock to the LA beat scene, Parsons then spent a number of years in London, studying new disciplines, experimenting and honing a sound, before eventually Awe Kid was born.\n\nA theme that remains consistent through Awe Kid's sound is the cooperation of melodic nostalgia with forward-thinking and contemporary sound design. In light of this, his instrumental arsenal – in the production process and recent live performances – relies on a combination of the traditional and ultra-modern, from analog synths to digital sampling and heavily processed vocal overlays. The result is a fusion of sounds that explore the territory between trip-hop, electronic jazz and left-field dance music."
